## Building from source
Use maven and the included pom.xml to build the source code. 
`  mvn install`

## Running natively
The run-native.sh script starts the Query Service natively using java and the compiled jar file.

## Docker support
After the jar file is built from source, it can be packaged in a Docker container using the provided build.sh script.
The following Docker-related scripts are provided:
* env.sh - defines environment variables used by other scripts
* build.sh - builds the Docker image
* run.sh - runs this service in a Docker container
* logs.sh - shows Docker container logs
* stop.sh - stops and removes the Docker container
* push.sh - pushes the image to a Docker registry
* pull.sh - pulls the image from a Docker registry
* status.sh - shows whether a Docker container is present and its status
* bash.sh - opens a bash shell into the Docker container while it is running
* entrypoint.sh - script that gets embedded in the Docker image, meant for execution inside the container only for starting the service
